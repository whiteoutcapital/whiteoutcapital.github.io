# Legal Disclaimer

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

This disclaimer applies to all past and future content published by Whiteout Capital, including posts that may contain older summary disclaimers linking to this page.

Whiteout Capital is a publication of Eudemonia 0x1 LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company registered to do business in the State of Colorado. The content provided on this website, newsletter, or any affiliated platforms (collectively, the “Service”) is for informational and educational purposes only. Nothing contained herein should be interpreted as personalized investment advice, a recommendation to buy or sell securities, or an offer or solicitation to transact in any financial instrument.

## No Investment Advice

The information presented is not, and should not be construed as, investment advice. All content reflects the author’s personal views and is intended for general informational purposes only. It is not tailored to the needs or objectives of any individual investor, and should not be relied upon as a substitute for personalized financial advice.

Use of the Service does not create a fiduciary, advisory, or client relationship between you and Eudemonia 0x1 LLC or the author. We do not offer or provide investment advisory services or portfolio management services in any capacity.

Readers should conduct their own due diligence and consult with their own financial, legal, or tax professionals before making any investment decisions. Eudemonia 0x1 LLC and Whiteout Capital are not registered investment advisers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any state or foreign securities authority.

Investing in equities—especially micro-cap, small-cap, and international securities—involves significant risk, including the risk of loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and no investment strategy or analysis guarantees returns or freedom from loss.

## Research Basis and Accuracy

The material provided is based on publicly available information, regulatory filings, and the author’s independent research and analysis. While we strive for accuracy, the content is provided on an “as-is” basis with no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

We do not guarantee the completeness, timeliness, reliability, or accuracy of any data or opinions presented. All statements are subject to change without notice and reflect the author’s personal opinion at the time of publication.

Any references to third-party sources (including websites, filings, data vendors, or research) are provided for convenience only and do not imply endorsement or guarantee of their accuracy or completeness.

The author may occasionally speak with company management teams for research purposes. These conversations are conducted with the understanding that no material non-public information (MNPI) is disclosed. Any insights derived from such discussions are intended to reflect broad, non-material context around the business, industry, or operations and are not relied upon as the basis for any forward-looking financial projection or trading decision.

## Forward-Looking Statements

Some content may contain forward-looking statements, including estimates, forecasts, or expectations about future events, business performance, or share price behavior. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and actual outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or implied.

Forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The author and Eudemonia 0x1 LLC undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of publication.

## Conflicts of Interest and Positions

The author, Eudemonia 0x1 LLC, and affiliated parties may hold long or short positions in the securities discussed and may buy or sell such securities at any time without notice. There is no guarantee that such positions will be maintained or disclosed in real time.

Any mention of personal ownership or trading activity reflects the author’s holdings at the time of writing and may change at any time. We do not undertake to provide updates on these holdings.

No content is written in exchange for compensation from any public company, issuer, or third party. If any form of compensation is ever received in connection with specific content, it will be disclosed prominently.

## No Offer, Solicitation, or Endorsement

Nothing on this site constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security or investment product. The content is not intended for use in any jurisdiction where such use would violate applicable laws or regulations. Readers are responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws and regulations.

Mentions of companies or securities do not constitute endorsements, promotional content, or financial sponsorship.

Subscription payments made to Whiteout Capital are solely in exchange for access to written content and do not constitute payment for investment advice, advisory services, or trade execution.

## No Legal, Tax, or Accounting Advice

Nothing in the Service constitutes legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should consult your own qualified professionals before making any financial or legal decisions that may have tax, legal, or regulatory implications.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the author nor Eudemonia 0x1 LLC nor any affiliates or contributors shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of, or reliance on, any information presented via the Service.

Use of the Service is at your own risk.
